I am currently a Lecturer of computer science at Yangzhou University. I graduated with a PhD in computer science from Jilin University in 2020. I am currently also a PostDoc at ISTIC, BeiJing, China.   

扬州大学信息工程学院讲师，中信所博士后。于2020年获得吉林大学计算机应用技术博士学位。  

My research interests include clustering algorithms, and its applications in different fields.
