I am currently a Lecturer of computer science at the Yangzhou University (扬州大学). I graduated with a PhD in computer science from Jilin University in  2020. I am also a PostDoc at ISTIC（中信所）, BeiJing, China. 

My research interests include Clustering algorithms, and its applications in different fields.
